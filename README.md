# Events

Event aggregate for Penn.

# Development


The quickest way to get started is just `foreman start`. This will run a few commands to automatically recompile static files on change, start a mongo database, and start the server.

# New Feature

Be able to "follow" specific events without following the creator of those events. As in, adding events to your own feed.
